```markdown
Lab Goals and Outcomes:

1. Install and setup your personal computer with the software tools required for this course
2. Practice using software tools
3. Practice terminal or shell commands
4. Practice keyboard shortcuts
5. Create your first Node.js server-side JavaScript file

```

### Technologies Used:
- Chrome
- VS Code
- Postman
- Git
- Node.js and included npm

### What I Learned:
I was introduced to VS Code and downloaded different extentions such as Prettier, ESLint, and GitHub Pull Requests and Issues. I downloaded and installed Node.js which included Node Package Manager, git, and Postman. I also navigated through Terminal in order to understand how to create directories, folders, files, and how to list and figure out where I was in my directory. In this lab I was also able to create my first Node Server-Side JavaScript File and execute it from the VS Code Terminal!
